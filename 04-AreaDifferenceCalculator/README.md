# Triangle Area Comparison (C#)

This project is a C# console application that calculates and compares the areas of two triangles using their side lengths.

The program reads the three sides of each triangle, computes their areas using **Heron's formula**, and determines which triangle has the larger area.

## Features
- Reads triangle side measurements from user input
- Calculates triangle area using Heron's formula
- Uses 'CultureInfo.InvariantCulture' for consistent decimal input/output
- Compares the areas of two triangles
- Displays the triangle with the largest area

## Concepts Practiced
- Methods and code reuse
- Mathematical formulas (Heron's formula)
- 'double' precision and formatted output
- Conditional statements
- Input handling with 'CultureInfo.InvariantCulture'

## How It Works
1. The user enters the three side lengths of triangle X.
2. The user enters the three side lengths of triangle Y.
3. The program calculates the area of each triangle.
4. The areas are compared and the triangle with the larger area is displayed.
5. If both areas are equal, the program informs the user.
