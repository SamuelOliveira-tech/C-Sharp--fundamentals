* Number Classifier (C#)

This project is a simple C# console application that allows the user to input an unlimited amount of integer numbers and classifies them as even or odd.

The program keeps reading numbers until the user presses "Enter" without typing any value.

* Features
- Dynamic input (no predefined limit of numbers)
- Stores values using `List<int>`
- Classifies numbers as **even** or **odd**
- Displays all entered numbers with their classification

* Concepts Practiced
- Lists (`List<int>`)
- Loops (`while`, `foreach`)
- Conditional statements (`if / else`)
- User input handling
- Basic number classification logic

* How It Works
1. The user types integer numbers one by one.
2. Each number is stored in a dynamic list.
3. When the user presses "Enter" with no input, the program stops reading.
4. All stored numbers are displayed and classified as even or odd.
